# Hi! I'm Steven Maloney. Nice to meet you!

I'm currently developing my software engineer skills at [Prime Digital Academy](https://primeacademy.io/) in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Prime is a great place because of its emphasis on real world working conditions. We are constantly working in teams and working on problems we do not know the answers to. We have worked our way up to developing full stack applications and we are on our speeding toward the final weeks of our time here when we will work on real projects for real organizations.
